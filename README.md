- Rest to be determined

## Setup
Add a file called **parse.xml** to the values folder (/app/src/main/res/values/). The contents should be:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="parse_application_id"></string>
    <string name="parse_client_key"></string>
    <string name="facebook_app_id"></string>
</resources>
```

You must insert the values for each of these. If you need them ask another group member.

***DO NOT COMMIT parse.xml***. It is in our .gitignore file so it shouldn't be an issue.
